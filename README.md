basic_app
=========

Basic skeleton of FirefoxOS App. This is a structure you can use as reference, or you can use other tools as Grunt (check https://github.com/pdi-innovation/generator-firefoxos).

The purpose of this is showing how a basic app is created, how to build the manifest and include some permissions to play with the features that the OS let us to play with (in this case, desktop notifications).

Internationalization has been included, showing you how to use it and how to add params when changing the language dinamically.
